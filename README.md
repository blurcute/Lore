#### Me

Hello, nice to meet you! I am Blur. I am a teenager from the United Kingdom that likes to work on projects as a hobby. I got first introduced to coding after discovering
Discord bots. I made my first ever bot in 2019, 2 years after joining discord, and started to learn and experiment with `discord.js` & `discord.py`. Basically, [`YouTube`](https://youtube.com/) and [`Stackoverflow`](https://stackoverflow.com/) are life savers.

#### Projects
- ðŸ¤– [**`Status Tracker`**](https://discord.gg/chats) - This bot tracked & logged status changing to role a reward.
- ðŸŽ‰ [**`Santa Wumpus`**](https://discordbotlist.com/bots/santa-lunar) - This bot was one of the biggest Giveaway bots of it's time.
- ðŸŽŠ [**`Santa Lunar`**](https://discordbotlist.com/bots/santa-lunar) - Re-branded from **Santa Wumpus** to **Santa Lunar**.
